# GiveBack

[GiveBack](https://radiant-sierra-32337.herokuapp.com/) was developed during iNTUition 2017, NTU's annual hackathon organized by [IEEE NTU Student Branch](http://www.ieeentu.com/).

## Inspiration
The need for a centralized platform that manages all kind of donations made to a given cause/campaign and gamification tools that encourage donors to continue.

## What it does
Our product is a gamified-donation platform, i.e. employs game mechanics in non-game contexts in order to boost engagement, and provide successful end-results. A simple, yet effective donations portal that beats the transient nature of existing funding platforms with gamification, and incentives to streamline all donations through one platform. Donations to charities in Singapore have been rising – over $1.1 billion in funding in 2014 and rising ever since. But both charities and donors feel the need for a streamlined process to handle donations, and no better way for donor retention than to gamify the process.

## What does our web app do?

- Allows potential donors to sign up and look out for the organizations and movements they support.
- Allows charities to seek funding efficiently without manning booths and stalls outside MRT stations
- Allows people to see impact of the funding they’ve provided
- Points for donation, and integration with social media
- Level ups and achievements – unlock rewards and vouchers sponsored by trusts/funds/organizations to incentivise giving.
- See the leader-board of donations for friends and celebrities who donate to your cause
